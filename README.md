## Netflix Over the Moon:  Explore space with Python and Visual Studio Code

Learning to code sometimes feels out of reach. But if I've learned anything from the people who have burst through our atmosphere, orbited our Earth, or walked on the Moon, 
it's that goals that seem out of reach require determination and passion. 

"Over the Moon" is a film about Fei Fei, a young girl who builds a rocket to the Moon on a mission to prove the existence of a legendary Moon Goddess. 
The girl is fueled by the memories and love of her mother to use determination and imagination to accomplish something beyond this world: reach the Moon. 
Although the story takes place in a beautifully drawn universe, it's directly related to the types of problems real-life engineers face as they prepare and execute missions to the Moon and beyond.

Tying together principles of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with tools like Python, Visual Studio Code, and Azure, upskilling in tech while imagining how to solve space travelâ€“related challenges.
