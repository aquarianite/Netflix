# 🌕 Over The Moon: Exploring Space with Python 🚀

This repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks and datasets used in the **Microsoft** module: *Explore Space with Python and Visual Studio Code*, inspired by Netflix’s **Over the Moon**.

What starts as a tribute to Fei Fei’s lunar dream becomes a hands-on data science journey using Python to analyze moon rock samples and make insightful recommendations for future missions, specifically NASA’s **Artemis program**.

## 🛰️ Project Overview

Moon rocks aren’t just rocks, they are keys to unlocking our solar system’s ancient past. These extraterrestrial samples hold vital clues about planetary formation and the history of Earth’s closest neighbor.

While NASA’s **Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office** maintains a comprehensive archive of samples from lunar and other missions, this project narrows its focus to those brought back by the **Apollo lunar missions** and **robotic probes**.

Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo missions returned a total of **383 kilograms** (over 800 pounds) of moon rocks, core samples, and soil — all categorized and made publicly available in the [NASA Lunar Sample and Photo Catalog](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/).

## 🌌 Project Aim

This project dives into:

- The **type**, **weight**, and **quantity** of lunar samples collected across missions  
- Patterns and insights drawn from this dataset  
- **Data-driven recommendations** for what the next astronauts should prioritize when they return to the Moon as part of **Artemis 2024**
